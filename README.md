This is my attempt to try to implement MLTT + UA in Agda. This will either be some sort of cubical Agda or more hopefully The Univalent Foundations. I will be following these [lecture notes](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/index.html) made by Martín Hötzel Escardó. His implementation along with the website is in the following [github](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTT-UF-Agda-Lecture-Notes) repo.

### My goals
I'm not yet fluent in Agda, but I know the semantics of the language quite well as I am very familiar with Haskell. This project will be me learning a new language, while trying to learn and understand the core consepts in UA.
