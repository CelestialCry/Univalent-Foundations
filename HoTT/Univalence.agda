The next notion of type are types with at most one element, i.e. any two elements are identified.

{-
We use the terminology subsingleton as -1-types acts as a subtype of a -2-type.
It follows that a type X is a subsingleton if and only if the map X -> 𝟙 is an embedding.
Under univalent excluded middle, the empty type 𝟘 and the singleton type 𝟙 are the only subsingletons, up to equivalence, or up to identity if we further assume univalence.
Subsingletons are also called propositions or truth values:
-}

isProp isTruthValue : 𝒰 ̇ -> 𝒰 ̇
isProp = isSubsingleton
isTruthValue = isSubsingleton
-- These are now simply synonyms for subsingletons

{-
The terminology is-subsingleton is more mathematical and avoids the clash with the slogan propositions as types, which is based on the interpretation of mathematical statements as arbitrary types, rather than just subsingletons. In these notes we prefer the terminology subsingleton, but we occasionally use the terminologies proposition and truth value. When we wish to emphasize this notion of proposition adopted in univalent mathematics, as opposed to “propositions as (arbitrary) types”, we may say univalent proposition.

In some formal systems, for example set theory based on first-order logic, one can tell that something is a proposition by looking at its syntactical form, e.g. “there are infinitely many prime numbers” is a proposition, by construction, in such a theory.

In univalent mathematics, however, propositions are mathematical, rather than meta-mathematical, objects, and the fact that a type turns out to be a proposition requires mathematical proof. Moreover, such a proof may be subtle and not immediate and require significant preparation. An example is the proof that the univalence axiom is a proposition, which relies on the fact that univalence implies function extensionality, which in turn implies that the statement that a map is an equivalence is a proposition. Another non-trivial example, which again relies on univalence or at least function extensionality, is the proof that the statement that a type X is a proposition is itself a proposition, which can be written as is-prop (is-prop X).

Singletons and subsingletons are also called -2-groupoids and -1-groupoids respectively.

Sets, 0-types or 0-groupoids is a nice type.
A type is a set if there is at most one way for two elements to be equal.
